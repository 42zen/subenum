# Sublist3r is Dead, so I Rebuilt it and Published it on pip


When it comes to hacking a server, the first step is **recon**naissance. We need to find as many doors as possible to try breaking in. And to do that, we find **subdomains**. If hacking into `facebook.com` is too hard, we will hack into `creators.facebook.com` and get some access from there instead. `facebook.com` is the domain, `creators.facebook.com` a subdomain.

To find subdomains, there is a well-known tool called **Sublist3r**, which searches for subdomains from public sources. After using the tool for a while, I noticed it missed a subdomain that I knew was publicly listed. Upon debugging, I discovered that **only one** of the tool's APIs was functioning properly, while the others were **completely outdated**.

At first, I started re-implementing the broken APIs, but after a few lines of code, I realized it would be much easier to rewrite the whole tool. I began with the **VirusTotal API**, which now requires an API key because the web endpoint is **no longer accessible without captchas**. Then, I discovered a **Shodan API** call I wasnâ€™t aware of that allows anyone to list subdomains. After that, I added some old-school websites to find subdomains: **crt.sh**, **DNSDumpster**, and **ThreatCrowd**. Finally, I wrote the search engine modules for **Google**, **Yahoo**, and **Bing**, and with a small layer of multithreading, I ended up with a tool called **subenum** that can find lots of subdomains in **just a few seconds**.

But that's not the end. After finishing the tool, I decided to add it to the PyPI package manager so that anyone can install **subenum** with the following command:
> pip install subenum

Once installed, you can access the **subenum** command directly from your terminal, simply run the following command:
> subenum example.com

This will print all the subdomains. If you want to **save them to a text file**, you can add the following parameter:
> subenum example.com -o subdomains.txt

Or, you can use it directly in your Python project:
```
from subenum import SubEnum
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
SHODAN_API_KEY = 'YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY'
subdomains = SubEnum(vt_api_key=VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY, shodan_api_key=SHODAN_API_KEY).get_subdomains("example.com")
for subdomain in subdomains:
    print(subdomain)
```

The tool works **without any API keys**, but if you want to maximize your results, you can add them in a `.env` file:
```
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
SHODAN_API_KEY=YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
```
It's free to make an account on [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) or [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) and you can check out the source code [here](https://github.com/42zen/subenum).
